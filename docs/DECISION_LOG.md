# ChangeMesh Decision Log

## ADR-0001 — Frozen project charter; no generic Phase-0
- Date: 2026-08-06
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: Agreed ChangeMesh charter replaces Universal Agent OS interactive Phase-0.
- Reason: Repeating discovery wastes time and can introduce drift.
- Consequence: Agents may ask only minimal blocking questions.

## ADR-0002 — ADK is product runtime
- Date: 2026-08-06
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: Google ADK runs product agents. Antigravity is development environment.
- Reason: Competition requires a real Gemini/Google Cloud autonomous product; development-tool behavior is not runtime proof.

## ADR-0003 — Autonomous by default, human-on-the-loop
- Date: 2026-08-06
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: Human authority only for irreversible, sensitive, privilege-expanding, or policy-defined actions.
- Reason: Reduce friction while meeting enterprise governance.

## ADR-0004 — Initial product wedge
- Date: 2026-08-06
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: Demonstrate high-risk schema/API change coordination using `customer_id → account_id`.
- Reason: Concrete cross-system impact, strong demo, credible product path.
